Background
----------

This game was built as part of a 48 hours Game Jam organised at Recurse Center in July 2016. The theme of the game jam was "Love In The Time Of...".

We explored the idea of "Love in the time of Elon Musk". Our game explores a futuristic world where, faced with the growing menace of artificial superintelligence, humanity decided to limit machines' ability to experience emotions as a safeguard. However, the symbiotic relationship between humans and machines, including the the gradual democratization of brain chip technology, resulted in humans themselves losing their own ability to experience emotions.
